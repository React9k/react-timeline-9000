# React Timeline 10000 (forked by the Flower Platform team)

## Intro

This fork is developed and maintained by the "Flower Platform" team (which FYI has authored in the past [Gantt4Flex](http://gantt4flex.crispico.com/), a popular (at that time) commercial Gantt diagramming component during the [Adobe Flex](http://flex.apache.org/) era). The motivation of our contributions is driven by the fact that we use "react-timeline-9000" in some of our industrial projects. The intention is to develop new features that we can use ASAP in our software. ALL our contributions are meant to be integrated in the upstream repo, so they are developed having this constraint in mind. The upstream repo is the **official** one (for releases, clone, adding issues, etc.). And this is to be considered as an internal repo for us = the Flower Platform team.

Admin discussions w/ the upstream repo team are held in [this issue](https://github.com/BHP-DevHub/react-timeline-9000/issues/183).

## Process and versioning

`package.json` on the **upstream repo** / `master` branch looks like this:

```
{
  "name": "react-timeline-9000",
  "version": "1.1.3",
  ...
```

But in **this repo** / `master-flower-platform` branch (which is considered to be the main branch of this repo) we have:

```
{
  "name": "@crispico/react-timeline-10000",
  "version": "1.1.3-fp-ver-3",
  ...
```

The `name` is changed so that we can publish it in our local NPM repo. We append to the original `version` the suffix `-fp-ver-N`. Where N is the version from Flower Platform. E.g. 3 means we added 3 commits compared to the original upstream. When a new contribution is added to our main branch = `master-flower-platform`, we increment this number. So we'll have e.g.: *1.1.3-fp-ver-**4***, *1.1.3-fp-ver-**5***, *1.1.**4**-fp-ver-**5***, *1.1.**4**-fp-ver-**6***, etc.

Before we begin new work, we should first create an issue in the upstream repo:
* we prefix it w/ *[rt10000]*, like in this [example](https://github.com/React9k/react-timeline-9000/issues/190);
* we explain what we want to do and ask for advice if needed.

New work is always done on new branches. E.g. `my-new-branch`. At the end of the work we **squash everything into a single commit** and perform a pull request towards upstream (mentioning the original issue cf. above). If we need the commit ASAP into our main branch:
* we don't need to wait for their approval of the PR;
* we make a PR and/or merge it into `master-flower-platform`;
* then, we increment *fp-ver-N* to *fp-ver-N+1* cf. above.

# Interaction

Default interaction for multiple selection is largely governed by the leading item, which is defined as the item that is directly interacted with when multiple items are selected.

## Dragging

All items will move by the same horizontal delta and row changes will be calculated by the row delta of the leading item

## Resizing

All items will gain the resize delta from the leading item.

### Overriding the default behaviour

TBA

`onInteraction(type, changes, leadTimeDelta, leaderGroupDelta,selectedItems)`
